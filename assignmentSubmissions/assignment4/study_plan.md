## 1- Survey for recruiting participants

Welcome!

The aim of this survey is to recruit participants for my study: **Exploring the experience of patients who suffer from chronic diseases regarding medication adherence.** If you are living with a chronic disease (diabetes, asthma, heart disease, COPD etc.) you are qualified for this study.

Please fill in the survey so that I can reach out to you for the next steps. The survey will take around 3 minutes to fill.

Thank you!
